## 🚀 1. What is Responsive Design?

Responsive design means your website looks great on **all screen sizes** — mobile, tablet, desktop, and beyond.

Bootstrap is built with a **mobile-first approach**, meaning the default styles are designed for mobile devices and then scaled up using breakpoints.

---

## 🎯 2. Bootstrap's Default Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Class Prefix | Devices                     |
| ---------- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| `xs`       | None         | <576px (extra small)        |
| `sm`       | `sm-`        | ≥576px (small)              |
| `md`       | `md-`        | ≥768px (medium)             |
| `lg`       | `lg-`        | ≥992px (large)              |
| `xl`       | `xl-`        | ≥1200px (extra large)       |
| `xxl`      | `xxl-`       | ≥1400px (extra extra large) |

📌 Prefixes are used to apply styles **starting at** that breakpoint.

## 🧱 3. Responsive Grid Layout Example

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-3 bg-light p-3 border">Column 1</div>
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-3 bg-light p-3 border">Column 2</div>
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-3 bg-light p-3 border">Column 3</div>
    <div class="col-12 col-sm-6 col-lg-3 bg-light p-3 border">Column 4</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

✅ This grid stacks on mobile, goes 2-columns on tablets, and 4-columns on desktops.

---

## 🎨 4. Responsive Text Utilities

Use Bootstrap’s responsive utility classes for typography:

```html
<p class="text-start text-sm-center text-lg-end">
  This text is left-aligned on mobile, centered on small screens, and right-aligned on large screens.
</p>
```

---

## 🖼️ 5. Responsive Images

Use `.img-fluid` to make images scale within their container:

```html
<img src="example.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive Image">
```

✅ Automatically resizes across breakpoints.

---

## 🎛️ 6. Visibility Utilities

Control element visibility using display utility classes:

| Class        | Effect                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `d-none`     | Hide on all screen sizes            |
| `d-sm-block` | Display as block on small and above |
| `d-md-none`  | Hide on medium and above            |

Example:

```html
<p class="d-none d-md-block">Only visible on medium and larger screens</p>
```

---

## 🧪 7. Practice Example: Responsive Card Grid

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-md-4 mb-3">
      <div class="card">
        <img src="img1.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
        <div class="card-body">
          <h5 class="card-title">Card 1</h5>
          <p class="card-text">This card is responsive!</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <!-- Repeat 2 more cards -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## 📌 8. Mobile-First Tips

* Start with the smallest screen layout.
* Use Bootstrap’s breakpoints to expand styling.
* Always use `.container` or `.container-fluid` for layouts.
* Use Flex utilities like `.flex-column flex-md-row` to change direction based on screen size.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips:

* ✅ Use `.order-` classes to reorder content responsively.
* ✅ Use `.w-100` with `.d-md-none` to create horizontal rules or breaks on small devices.
* ✅ Combine `.text-` and `.align-items-` utilities for responsive alignment.

---

## 🧪 Mini Exercise

> 🔧 **Task**: Build a 3-card layout that stacks on mobile, shows two columns on tablet, and 3 columns on desktop.
> Try it on CodePen or VS Code with live preview.
