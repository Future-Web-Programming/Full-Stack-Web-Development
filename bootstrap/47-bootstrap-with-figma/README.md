## 🧑‍🎨 Step-by-Step: From Figma to Bootstrap

### 1. 📥 Getting the Figma File

* Ask the designer to share the **Figma file or prototype link**.
* Open it in [Figma](https://figma.com) (free account works fine).
* Use the “Inspect” panel to see spacing, fonts, colors, etc.

### 2. 🎨 Extracting Design Specs

Figma provides CSS-like styles for:

* Font sizes (`font-size`)
* Line height
* Margins & paddings
* Colors (`#hex`)
* Border radius, box shadows

### 3. 🏗️ Laying Out the Structure with Bootstrap

Use:

* `.container` and `.container-fluid`
* `.row` and `.col-md-6`, `.col-lg-4`, etc.
* Spacing utilities: `.pt-4`, `.px-3`, `.mb-5`

### 4. 🎯 Matching Typography

* Headings: Use `display-1`, `h1`, etc.
* Paragraphs: Use `lead`, `text-muted`, `text-secondary`
* Font families: Customize via Bootstrap variables or Google Fonts

### 5. 🎛️ Matching Components

Example:

* Figma Button → `<button class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">`
* Card UI → Use Bootstrap card + custom utility classes
* Navbars → Use responsive Bootstrap navs and dropdowns

### 6. 🧑‍💻 Custom Styles via SCSS or Utility API

To match exact design:

* Use Bootstrap SCSS variables to override colors, fonts, radii
* Or use Utility API to generate one-off classes like `.text-brand`, `.bg-accent`

### 7. 📱 Make It Responsive

* Use Bootstrap grid + breakpoints
* Use `.d-none d-md-block` to hide/show
* Use `.order-1`, `.order-md-2` for layout swapping

## 💼 Real-World Use Case

A client sends you a **SaaS dashboard UI design in Figma**, and asks you to convert it into a Bootstrap frontend. Your job:

* Extract fonts, colors, spacing.
* Recreate sections using cards, navbars, footers.
* Make it responsive.
* Match it pixel-perfect.

---

## 🧠 Pro Tips

* Use `figma.com/design` inspect panel instead of guessing.
* Don’t hardcode pixels — Bootstrap prefers `rem`, `%`, or classes.
* Figma designs might not follow Bootstrap’s spacing system, so you’ll need to adapt without breaking layout.

---
