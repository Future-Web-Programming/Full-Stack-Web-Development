## 📌 What You’ll Learn

* What is **Memory Management** in JavaScript?
* Difference between **Stack** and **Heap**
* How JavaScript stores **variables, objects, and functions**
* What is **Garbage Collection**?
* How to avoid **memory leaks**
* 🛠 Best practices for managing memory in your code

## 📦 Memory in JavaScript

Every time you run JS code, the engine allocates memory to store:

* 🧮 **Primitive values** (like numbers, strings)
* 🗂 **Objects and functions**
* 📁 **Execution contexts**

This memory is managed using two main structures:

---

## 🧠 Stack vs Heap

| Feature      | Stack                                          | Heap                                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Purpose      | Stores **primitive values** and function calls | Stores **objects**, arrays, functions |
| Access Speed | Super fast 🚀                                  | Slower 🐢                             |
| Structure    | LIFO (Last In First Out)                       | Unstructured                          |
| Size         | Small                                          | Large                                 |
| Example      | `let a = 5;`                                   | `let obj = { name: 'Ali' }`           |

---

### 🧱 Stack (Call Stack)

Used for:

* **Primitive values** (`number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, `bigint`)
* **Function execution**

🧠 Think of it like:

> A vertical stack of memory slots, one on top of the other.

🧪 Example:

```js
let name = "Ali";
let age = 25;
```

* Both go to the **stack**.

---

### 🗂 Heap (Dynamic Memory)

Used for:

* **Objects**, **Arrays**, and **Functions**

📦 Think of it like:

> A big messy drawer where items are placed anywhere, but you need a label (reference) to access them.

🧪 Example:

```js
let person = {
  name: "Ali",
  age: 25
};
```

* Object is stored in the **heap**
* `person` (the variable) holds a **reference** in the **stack**

---

## 🔄 How They Work Together

```js
let user = {
  username: "futuredev",
  score: 90
};
```

* Stack: variable `user` → holds reference like `0x123`
* Heap: object `{ username: "futuredev", score: 90 }` stored at `0x123`

---

## 🧹 Garbage Collection in JavaScript

JavaScript automatically **cleans up unused memory**. This is called **Garbage Collection (GC)**.

It uses the **Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**:

1. JS engine **marks** all variables that are still reachable.
2. **Unreachable** memory (not used anywhere) is **swept away**.

---

### 🔁 Reachability

A value is “reachable” if it can still be accessed or referenced in your code.

```js
let user = {
  name: "Ali"
};

user = null; // object becomes unreachable
// Garbage Collector will clean it
```

## ⚠️ Common Causes of Memory Leaks

| Issue            | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Global variables | Unintentionally keeping data in memory                  |
| Closures         | Retaining references to unused variables                |
| Event Listeners  | Not removed properly                                    |
| Timers/Intervals | Not cleared using `clearInterval()` or `clearTimeout()` |
| DOM References   | Elements removed from DOM but still referenced in JS    |

---

### 🧪 Example Memory Leak:

```js
let items = [];
function addItem() {
  items.push(new Array(1000000).join("leak"));
}
setInterval(addItem, 1000); // Memory keeps growing! 🚨
```

---

## ✅ How to Avoid Memory Leaks

1. ❌ Avoid unused global variables
2. 🧽 Remove event listeners when not needed
3. ⏱ Clear intervals/timers when done
4. ♻️ Nullify references when done: `object = null`
5. ✅ Use **tools** like Chrome DevTools → Memory tab

---

## 🔧 Visual Tools to Track Memory

* 🧰 Chrome DevTools → Performance → Memory
* 🔍 Firefox DevTools → Heap Snapshots
* 🧼 Tools: [PerfLink](https://perf.link/), [JS Heap Profiler](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/memory/)

## 🎯 Summary

| Topic      | Key Point                              |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Stack      | Fast, structured, stores primitives    |
| Heap       | Stores objects, slower access          |
| GC         | JS auto-cleans unreachable memory      |
| Leaks      | Caused by closures, globals, listeners |
| Prevention | Clean code, null references, use tools |

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Assignment

1. Write a simple program with nested objects and observe how memory is used.
2. Try Chrome DevTools → Record a **Heap Snapshot**
3. Create an intentional leak using `setInterval()` — then fix it.
