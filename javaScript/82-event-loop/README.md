# 🟦 Chapter 82: The Event Loop, Callback Queue & Microtasks 🔄

---

## 🎯 **Objective**

Understand how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations behind the scenes using the **event loop**, **callback queue**, and **microtask queue** — the engine that powers your browser’s JS magic ✨.

---

## 🧠 Why This Chapter Matters

JavaScript is **single-threaded**, meaning it executes one line at a time. But how does it handle timeouts, HTTP requests, DOM events, or Promises?

This is where the **event loop mechanism** comes in. It’s the foundation of **asynchronous JavaScript**, and mastering it makes you ready for real-world app performance, debugging, and async programming.

---

## 📌 Key Concepts We’ll Cover

* What is the **Call Stack**?
* What is the **Web APIs environment** (Browser or Node.js)?
* What is the **Callback Queue**?
* What is the **Microtask Queue**?
* How the **Event Loop** works step-by-step
* 🧪 Visual Demo using `setTimeout`, `Promise`, and `console.log`

## 🔁 The Big Picture

```
JavaScript Runtime Environment
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│     Call Stack              │ <─── Executes current task
└─────────────────────────────┘
          ▲
          │
 Event Loop checks continuously 🔄
          │
     ┌─────────────┬──────────────┐
     │ Callback    │ Microtasks   │
     │ Queue       │ Queue        │
     └─────────────┴──────────────┘
```

---

## 📦 1. What is the Call Stack?

The **Call Stack** is where functions get executed, one at a time.

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello");
}

function sayHi() {
  greet();
}

sayHi();
```

> Order:
> `sayHi()` ➝ `greet()` ➝ `console.log("Hello")`

✅ **Stack is LIFO** (Last In, First Out)

---

## 🌐 2. Web APIs (Browser or Node.js)

When you run asynchronous code like:

```js
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("After 2 seconds");
}, 2000);
```

This `setTimeout` is **not handled by the JS engine** but by the **Browser/Web APIs**, which manages the timer.

---

## 📥 3. Callback Queue

After the timer ends, the callback function is sent to the **Callback Queue**, waiting for the **Call Stack to be empty**.

---

## 📥 4. Microtask Queue (Priority Queue)

Microtasks are like **Promises**, `.then()`, `MutationObserver`, `queueMicrotask()`.

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Microtask executed");
});
```

✅ **Always executed before Callback Queue**

---

## 🔄 5. The Event Loop – Step by Step

The **Event Loop** constantly checks:

1. 👉 Is the **Call Stack empty**?
2. 👉 If yes:

   * First: Run all **Microtasks** from Microtask Queue
   * Then: Run 1 task from **Callback Queue**
3. 🔁 Repeat

---

## 🧪 6. Let's See it in Action

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout Callback");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log("Promise Microtask");
});

console.log("End");
```

### 🧾 Output:

```
Start
End
Promise Microtask
Timeout Callback
```

### 🔍 Why?

| Step                                                    | Explanation                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| ✅ `Start`                                               | Runs immediately                  |
| ✅ `setTimeout()`                                        | Goes to Web APIs, callback waits  |
| ✅ `Promise`                                             | `.then()` goes to Microtask Queue |
| ✅ `End`                                                 | Call Stack finishes               |
| 🌀 Event Loop checks → Runs Microtask first (`Promise`) |                                   |
| ⏱ Then runs Callback (`setTimeout`)                     |                                   |

---

## 🧩 Bonus: What if you block the stack?

```js
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Timeout fired");
}, 0);

// Block the stack
for (let i = 0; i < 1e9; i++) {} // long loop

console.log("End");
```

Even though `setTimeout` was set to 0ms, it **waits** until the blocking is over. That’s the single-threaded nature of JS.

## 👨‍💻 Project Demo (Optional)

Build a mini **task scheduler simulator** in JavaScript:

* Use buttons to trigger `setTimeout` vs `Promise`
* Display in browser how tasks are queued and executed

## ✅ Summary

| Concept         | Description                              |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Call Stack      | Executes JS one line at a time           |
| Web APIs        | Browser handles async work (timers, DOM) |
| Callback Queue  | Stores `setTimeout`, `click`, etc.       |
| Microtask Queue | Higher priority (Promises)               |
| Event Loop      | Moves tasks into the Call Stack          |

## 📘 Homework / Practice

1. Write code using `setTimeout` and `Promise` to test output order
2. Try using `queueMicrotask()`
3. Try blocking the stack to observe delays
4. Explain the Event Loop in your own words (bonus for video creators!)

---

## 📺 In Your YouTube Lecture

✅ Suggested flow:

* Start with **Call Stack**
* Visually explain **Queues**
* Live demo via **console**
* Show real browser diagram using DevTools
* Encourage open tabs of CodePen + JS Visualizer
