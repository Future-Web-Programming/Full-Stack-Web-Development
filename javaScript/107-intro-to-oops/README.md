Perfect — we’re now fully aligned with your extended outline and vision for creating the world’s most comprehensive and practical JavaScript course.

Let’s officially begin:

---

## ✅ Chapter 107: **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript**

> 🎯 *Goal: Understand the core principles of OOP, why it matters in JavaScript, and how it differs from classical OOP in languages like Java or C++.*

---

### 📌 What You’ll Learn in This Chapter:

* What is OOP and Why It’s Important
* OOP in JavaScript vs Classical OOP
* Core OOP Concepts: Objects, Classes, Instances
* Introduction to OOP Pillars: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
* Use Cases: When and Why to Use OOP in Real-World JS Projects

---

### 🧠 What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?

Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm centered around **objects**, which are reusable units containing data (properties) and behavior (methods). OOP is designed to model real-world things in code.

In JavaScript, almost everything is an object: arrays, functions, DOM elements — even other objects.

### 🧱 Key OOP Concepts

| Concept           | Description                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class**         | A blueprint to create objects (instances) with similar properties/methods |
| **Object**        | An instance of a class                                                    |
| **Property**      | Data associated with an object                                            |
| **Method**        | Function associated with an object                                        |
| **Encapsulation** | Hiding internal data/state using closures or private fields               |
| **Inheritance**   | Objects or classes can inherit features from other objects/classes        |
| **Polymorphism**  | Same method name can behave differently in different contexts             |
| **Abstraction**   | Exposing only relevant details to the user and hiding internal complexity |

### 📦 OOP in JavaScript vs Traditional Languages

| Feature              | JavaScript                                          | Java/C++                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Type System          | Dynamically typed                                   | Statically typed                             |
| Class Implementation | Prototype-based inheritance                         | Classical class-based inheritance            |
| Object Creation      | Via constructors, factory functions, or ES6 `class` | Via `class` keyword and object instantiation |

---

### 🛠️ Simple Example of OOP in JavaScript (ES6)

```js
// Class definition
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  greet() {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

// Object instantiation
const student = new Person("Ayesha", 21);
student.greet(); // Hi, I'm Ayesha and I'm 21 years old.
```

### 🧪 Real-Life Analogy

> Imagine a "Car" class. Every individual car (object) shares common characteristics (properties like `color`, `brand`) and abilities (methods like `drive()`, `brake()`).

---

### 🤔 Why Use OOP in JavaScript?

* Structure large apps better
* Create reusable code components
* Build libraries and frameworks (React is OOP-based internally)
* Improve code readability and maintainability
* Handle complexity via abstraction and encapsulation

---

### 🧪 Mini Practice

Try creating your own class `Book` with the following:

* `title`, `author`, and `year` as properties
* a method `getSummary()` that returns: *“Book title by Author (Year)”*

<details>
<summary>✅ Click to Reveal Solution</summary>

```js
class Book {
  constructor(title, author, year) {
    this.title = title;
    this.author = author;
    this.year = year;
  }

  getSummary() {
    return `${this.title} by ${this.author} (${this.year})`;
  }
}

const jsBook = new Book("JavaScript Mastery", "Future Programming", 2025);
console.log(jsBook.getSummary());
```

</details>
