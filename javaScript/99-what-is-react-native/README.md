# üì± Chapter 99: What is React Native? Mobile App Basics

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you'll:

* Understand what **React Native** is and how it differs from React.js
* Learn how to set up a React Native development environment
* Build your **first mobile app** using React Native
* Explore React Native components and styling
* Understand how JavaScript powers real mobile apps (Android + iOS)

---

## üöÄ What is React Native?

> **React Native** is a **cross-platform framework** created by **Meta (Facebook)** that allows developers to **build native mobile apps** using **JavaScript** and **React**.

‚úÖ **One codebase**, runs on both **iOS and Android**

‚úÖ Uses **native components** (not web views like hybrid frameworks)

‚úÖ Ideal for those who already know **JavaScript + React**

## üß† React vs React Native ‚Äì What's the Difference?

| Feature    | React (Web)               | React Native (Mobile)                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Platform   | Web browsers              | iOS + Android                              |
| DOM        | Uses HTML DOM             | Uses native mobile components              |
| Styling    | CSS                       | `StyleSheet.create()` (like inline styles) |
| Routing    | React Router              | React Navigation                           |
| Components | `<div>`, `<button>`, etc. | `<View>`, `<Text>`, `<Button>`             |

## üõ†Ô∏è React Native Setup Options

### üü© Beginner-Friendly: **Expo (Recommended)**

> No need to install Android Studio or Xcode initially

1. Install Expo CLI:

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

2. Create your first project:

```bash
npx create-expo-app myFirstApp
cd myFirstApp
npm start
```

3. Install the **Expo Go** app on your phone (iOS or Android)
   Scan the QR code and run the app live!

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Pro-Level: **React Native CLI (Full Control)**

Requires installing Android Studio / Xcode (macOS only for iOS).

```bash
npx react-native init MyApp
cd MyApp
npx react-native run-android
```

---

## üì± Your First React Native App (Expo)

```jsx
// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Text, View, Button, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';

export default function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.text}>Count: {count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increase" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 24, marginBottom: 10,
  },
});
```

## üì¶ Built-in Core Components

| React Native Component | Purpose                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `<View>`               | Like a `<div>` container |
| `<Text>`               | Renders text             |
| `<Button>`             | Native button            |
| `<TextInput>`          | Input field              |
| `<Image>`              | Displays an image        |
| `<ScrollView>`         | Makes content scrollable |

---

## üé® Styling in React Native

React Native uses JavaScript styles (not traditional CSS).

```js
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  box: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    width: 100,
    height: 100,
  }
});
```

---

## üîå Navigation & Screens

Use `react-navigation` to move between screens:

```bash
npm install @react-navigation/native
```

You'll learn multi-screen apps in later chapters.

## üì± Live Testing Options

| Method               | Platform                      | Tools Used               |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Expo Go App**      | Android/iOS phone             | Live preview via QR      |
| **Android Emulator** | Desktop (Windows/Linux/macOS) | Android Studio required  |
| **Xcode Simulator**  | macOS only                    | Required for iOS testing |
