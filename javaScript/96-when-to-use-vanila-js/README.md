# üÜö **Chapter 96: When to Use Vanilla JavaScript vs Frameworks**

---

## üéØ Learning Goals:

By the end of this chapter, you will:

* Understand **when to use Vanilla JS** and when to use **a framework like React/Next.js**
* Learn the **pros and cons** of both approaches
* Identify the **right tool for your project**
* Avoid **overengineering** or **underengineering**

---

## üß† Why This Chapter Matters

Many beginners rush to frameworks too early ‚Äî before mastering JavaScript fundamentals.
This chapter helps you **make better decisions**, especially if you are:

* Starting a **new project**
* Working in a **team**
* Planning your **portfolio**
* Preparing for **interviews**

## üü¢ Vanilla JavaScript (No Framework)

Vanilla JS = Plain JavaScript + DOM + APIs

‚úÖ **Use Vanilla JS when:**

| Situation              | Why                       |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Learning JavaScript    | Builds deep understanding |
| Building small apps    | No need for overhead      |
| Prototypes / MVPs      | Faster and lighter        |
| Simple static websites | Frameworks are overkill   |
| You want full control  | No hidden abstraction     |

### üß™ Examples:

* Calculator
* To-do list
* Clock app
* Portfolio site (basic)
* HTML forms with validation

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* No build setup
* Zero dependencies
* Fast initial load
* Full control of code

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Harder to scale large apps
* More boilerplate (repetitive code)
* DOM handling gets complex
* Less readable when complex

## üîµ Frameworks like React / Next.js

React = UI library
Next.js = Framework built on React

‚úÖ **Use React/Next.js when:**

| Situation                          | Why                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| App has many components            | React makes reusable blocks easy   |
| Needs dynamic data & state         | React hooks & state simplify this  |
| SEO needed                         | Use Next.js for server-rendering   |
| Working in a team                  | Easy collaboration with components |
| Large apps with routing, API, auth | Frameworks scale better            |
| You need fast development          | Huge ecosystem, CLI tools          |

### üß™ Examples:

* Dashboard
* E-commerce site
* Blog with SEO
* Admin panels
* Real-time chat app

### ‚úÖ Pros:

* Reusable components
* Fast updates (Virtual DOM)
* Better performance with SSR (Next.js)
* Ecosystem (Redux, Tailwind, Firebase, etc.)

### ‚ùå Cons:

* Learning curve
* More setup (especially Next.js)
* Sometimes overkill for small apps
* Performance hit if used poorly

## üß© Decision Table

| App Type        | Vanilla JS | React | Next.js |
| --------------- | ---------- | ----- | ------- |
| Calculator      | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå     | ‚ùå       |
| Blog (SEO)      | ‚ùå          | ‚ö†Ô∏è    | ‚úÖ       |
| Real-time Chat  | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ       |
| Landing Page    | ‚úÖ          | ‚ùå     | ‚ö†Ô∏è      |
| E-commerce      | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ       |
| Portfolio       | ‚úÖ          | ‚ö†Ô∏è    | ‚úÖ       |
| Admin Dashboard | ‚ùå          | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ       |

## üõ† Developer Tip

> üöÄ **Start with Vanilla JS, move to Frameworks when the need arises.**

Frameworks are tools, not magic. If you understand the core of JavaScript, you'll use frameworks **effectively**, not blindly.

---

## üß™ Challenge: Refactor a Vanilla JS App to React

Take any previous project (like a to-do list) and try to:

* Rewrite it using **React**
* Create components for form, list, item
* Use `useState` for data management
* Compare code length, readability, reusability

## üí¨ Summary

| Topic      | Summary                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Vanilla JS | Perfect for small apps and learning core JS              |
| Frameworks | Great for scalability, performance, teamwork             |
| Key Skill  | Knowing **when** to use **which** tool                   |
| Goal       | Use the **simplest possible solution** for your use case |
