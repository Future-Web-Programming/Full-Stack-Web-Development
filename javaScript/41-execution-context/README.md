Perfect! Let’s dive deep into the inner engine of JavaScript in **Chapter 41** — one of the most crucial (and most misunderstood) topics:

# 🟩 Chapter 41: JavaScript Execution Context & Call Stack

🔍 *How JavaScript Runs Code Behind the Scenes*

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this chapter, students will:

* Understand how JavaScript **executes** code
* Learn about the **Execution Context**
* Grasp the difference between **Global** and **Function Execution Context**
* See how the **Call Stack** works
* Be able to visualize how code flows step-by-step

---

## 🔧 What is an Execution Context?

> The *Execution Context* is the environment in which JavaScript code is evaluated and executed.

Every time JavaScript runs a script or function, it creates a new **execution context**.

---

## 🌍 1. Global Execution Context (GEC)

This is the default context where your JS code starts running.

```js
let name = "Ali";
console.log(name);
```

### In the background, JavaScript creates:

* A **Global Object** (`window` in browser, `global` in Node)
* A special variable called `this`
* A **Memory (Variable Environment)** for variables and functions

---

## 🔁 2. Function Execution Context (FEC)

Every time a function is called, a **new execution context** is created:

```js
function greet(name) {
  let message = "Hello " + name;
  console.log(message);
}
greet("Ahmed");
```

JavaScript creates a **new environment** for each function execution:

* Memory phase (allocates variables)
* Execution phase (runs the code)

---

## 🧠 Visualizing Execution

```js
let a = 10;
function double(x) {
  let result = x * 2;
  return result;
}
let output = double(a);
console.log(output);
```

1. GEC created
2. `a` declared and assigned
3. `double()` is placed in memory
4. When `double(a)` is called → new FEC
5. FEC finishes → popped off the call stack
6. Log `output`

---

## 📚 Memory Creation Phase vs Execution Phase

```js
function test() {
  let x = 5;
  let y = 10;
  return x + y;
}
```

* 🔹 **Memory phase:** x and y are set as `undefined`
* 🔹 **Execution phase:** x = 5, y = 10, returns 15

---

## 🏗️ What is the Call Stack?

The **Call Stack** keeps track of function execution.

Imagine stacking plates — Last In, First Out (LIFO):

```js
function one() {
  two();
  console.log("One");
}
function two() {
  console.log("Two");
}
one();
```

🧱 Call Stack:

1. `one()` pushed
2. `two()` pushed
3. `two()` finishes → popped
4. `console.log("One")`
5. `one()` finishes → popped

---

## 📉 Call Stack Overflow

What happens if you keep calling functions endlessly?

```js
function infinite() {
  return infinite();
}
infinite(); // ❌ Stack overflow
```

You’ll crash the stack — because it never gets a chance to pop anything out!

---

## 📊 Execution Context vs Call Stack (Diagram)

```plaintext
         [ Global Execution Context ]
                     ↓
           [ Function: one() ]
                     ↓
           [ Function: two() ]
```

Each function execution pushes a new **Execution Context** on top of the **Call Stack**.

* Variable hoisting
* Function calls
* Stack behavior

---

## 💡 Bonus: Lexical Scope vs Execution Context

Lexical scope is where functions are **written**.
Execution context is what happens when functions are **executed**.

They’re different but **work together**.

---

## 🧪 Practice Questions

1. Trace the execution and call stack for this code:

```js
function start() {
  console.log("Start");
  process();
  console.log("End");
}
function process() {
  console.log("Processing...");
}
start();
```

2. Create a function chain: `a()` → `b()` → `c()` → `console.log()`

3. Simulate a stack overflow using recursion.

## ✅ Summary

| Concept            | Meaning                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Execution Context  | Environment where code runs             |
| Global Execution   | Default context (whole JS file)         |
| Function Execution | Created every time a function is called |
| Memory Phase       | Allocates variables/functions           |
| Execution Phase    | Executes code                           |
| Call Stack         | Tracks what’s running                   |
