## HTML Block Level and Inline Elements

In HTML, elements can be categorized as either block-level elements or inline elements, depending on how they are displayed on a web page.

### Block-level elements

block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

>Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width of their parent container.

## Inline elements
on the other hand, Inline elements, are elements that only take up as much space as necessary to display their content. 

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
