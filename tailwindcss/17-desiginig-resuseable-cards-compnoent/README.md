### 🖼️ Responsive Card Grid Layout

```html
<div class="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-6 p-4">
  <!-- Repeat cards here -->
</div>
```

---

### 🧑‍💻 Real-World Mini Project:

> **Card Showcase UI**

Create a section containing:

* 🔹 Blog Card
* 🔹 Product Card
* 🔹 Profile Card

Use responsive grid/flex layout. Make sure:

* All cards are visually consistent
* Each card uses Tailwind's utility classes
* Reusable and responsive

---

### 🔥 Bonus: Card with Hover Animation

```html
<div class="transform hover:-translate-y-1 hover:shadow-xl transition duration-300">
  <!-- card content -->
</div>
```

---

### 📌 Best Practices:

* Use `max-w-sm`, `shadow`, and `rounded` to create clean layouts.
* Combine `object-cover` with image sizing for consistent media.
* Add `transition` + `hover` for engaging UI feedback.
* Use `grid` or `flex` with `gap` for responsive arrangements.

---

### ✅ Outcome of Chapter 17:

Students will be able to:

* Build 3+ types of real-world cards
